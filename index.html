                <p>
                    My passion for technology has always lead me to approach my career with a pragmatic, yet  creative perspective. 
                    Having recently come to the end of a rewarding apprenticeship, 
                    I am now looking towards the next step in my professional pursuits with an established confidence in my abilities, as well as a fervency to inject my insight into a new opportunity.
